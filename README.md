# EZ-Cases
My Python script that makes it a million times easier and less tedious to create cases in our microscope imaging systems. 

## Metafer
The Metafer System takes barcode labels made using the Zebra Printer. ZebraDesgner Pro allows import from an XLS file for mass printing. My CUMC_TO_XLS.py script generates the XLS file to be used for this.

## ASI
The ASI System prints it's own barcodes by creating cases with slide names in it's own software. This software imports XML files. My CUMC_TO_XML.py script generates the XML file to be used for this.
